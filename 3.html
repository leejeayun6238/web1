        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
       
        <P>JavaScript ( JS ) is a lightweight, interpreted or just-in-time compiled programming language that supports first- class functions . Although well known as a scripting language for web pages, it is also used by many non-browser environments such as Node.js , Apache CouchDB , and Adobe Acrobat . JavaScript is a prototype-based , multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (such as functional programming) styles. For more information , see About JavaScript .

            That section covers the JavaScript language itself, not web pages or other usage environments. For information on a specific API of a web page, see Web API and DOM .</P>
