        <h2>CSS</h2>
       
        <P>Cascading Style Sheets ( CSS ) is a style sheet language for describing how to display documents written in HTML or XML (including SVG and XHTML , which are dialects of XML ) . CSS specifies how elements should be rendered on screen, paper, audio or other media.

            CSS is one of the core languages ​​of the open web , and the W3C specification works as a standard for various browsers. In the past, various parts of the CSS specification were developed sequentially, so it was possible to attach versions like CSS1, CSS2.1, and CSS3. But the official version won't go up to CSS4.</P>
